# Solana NFT Minting Website - Setup Guide

## üöÄ Your Solana NFT Minting Website is Ready!

This is a fully functional Solana NFT minting website with wallet integration, candy machine support, and a stunning dark neon theme. The site is currently configured for Solana **Devnet**.

## ‚úÖ What's Already Built

### Core Features
- **Wallet Integration**: Phantom, Solflare, Torus, and Ledger wallet support
- **Candy Machine Integration**: Ready for your candy machine ID
- **Responsive Design**: Beautiful dark theme with neon accents
- **User Interface**: Complete minting interface with quantity selection
- **Real-time Status**: Connection status and minting feedback
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user notifications

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Blockchain**: Solana Web3.js + Wallet Adapter
- **Metaplex**: Candy Machine integration ready
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui with custom neon styling

## üîß Next Steps - What You Need to Do

### 1. Add Your Candy Machine Details
You can add your candy machine ID and collection address directly in the website interface, or you can hardcode them:

**Option A: Use the Interface (Recommended)**
- Just enter your Candy Machine ID and Collection Address in the mint form
- The website will save and use these values

**Option B: Hardcode in the Code**
Edit `src/components/mint/MintCard.tsx` and replace the default values:
```typescript
const [localCandyMachineId, setLocalCandyMachineId] = useState('YOUR_CANDY_MACHINE_ID_HERE');
const [localCollectionAddress, setLocalCollectionAddress] = useState('YOUR_COLLECTION_ADDRESS_HERE');
```

### 2. Implement Actual Minting Logic
The minting button currently shows a placeholder. To implement real minting, you need to:

1. **Install additional Metaplex dependencies** (if needed):
```bash
npm install @metaplex-foundation/mpl-token-metadata
```

2. **Update the mint function** in `src/components/mint/MintCard.tsx`:
```typescript
// Replace the placeholder mint function with actual Metaplex candy machine integration
// Example implementation would go in the handleMint function
```

### 3. Configure Candy Machine Settings
In `src/components/mint/MintCard.tsx`, update the stats to match your actual candy machine:
- **Price**: Change from "0.1 SOL" to your actual mint price
- **Remaining**: Connect to your candy machine to show real remaining count
- **Rarity**: Update based on your collection details

### 4. Customize Branding
- **Logo**: Your logo is already integrated from the uploaded image
- **Collection Name**: Currently set to "Diamond Gifted Chain" - update in `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`
- **Colors**: The neon theme can be customized in `src/index.css`

### 5. Deploy to Production
When ready for mainnet:
1. Change network from 'devnet' to 'mainnet-beta' in `src/components/providers/SolanaProvider.tsx`
2. Update your candy machine ID to the mainnet version
3. Test thoroughly on devnet first!

## üé® Design System

The website uses a custom neon design system with:
- **Primary Colors**: Purple, Cyan, Pink neon accents
- **Dark Theme**: Deep dark background with glowing elements
- **Animations**: Pulse effects, gradient animations, hover glows
- **Typography**: Neon glow effects on headings
